2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[My biggest challenge I encountered was trying to center a few elements (the start/stop button and the icons). Although I have experience with CSS, there are some new elements that have been implemented since I took a pause from development. I've been working on getting comfortable using flexbox with some of my other projects, so I played around with some of the elements and I used one of the resources I linked in the first question to center everything properly.]


3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[Most of my questions surround Javascript. ]


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
